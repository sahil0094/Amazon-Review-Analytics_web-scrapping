For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨\n",

      "---\n",
      "The iPhone 11 Pro Max is a superb smartphone that caters to most basic needs of any individual. For starters, the phone has a mind boggling 1.5 days of battery under normal usage and you'll still go beyond a day with extremely heavy usage too, the phone just isn't ready to give up. The iPhone 11 Pro Max supposedly also has a tremendous camera though I cannot vouch for the same since I rarely use my phone's camera. But the best part about this smartphone is its performance, it runs at supersonic speed, no waiting Time ever required for anything. The only chinks in the armour surface from a lacklustre iOS 13 release, which although has some great features, is currently under a lot of stress and duress with some major bugs creeping into the software, the most important being the non-working of the ever so ubiquitous Reminders app. But that is only a passing phase as the rollout of major releases with bug fixes should fix most problems in the coming few days, in the coming few weeks and in the coming few months. But in any case, that simply does not take anything away from iPhone 11 Pro Max, its a wonderful smartphone that should suffice the needs of most new users as well as those of most brand loyalists alike. Apple has finally delivered an uber cool device after a few sombre years where the company's growth seemed to had hit a plateau. The iPhone 11 Pro Max, even though not being too innovative, is arguably the best premium smartphone in the market available by far for almost everything that a smartphone should be and the phone should give Apple a sizeable lead over its main competitors, Samsung and OnePlus, now that Huawei has hit a roadblock. But in all, you cannot go wrong with the iPhone 11 Pro Max, so you shouldn't think twice while buying this smartphone, it is indeed a very fruitful investment!!\n",
